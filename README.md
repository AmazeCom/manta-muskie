# manta-muskie: The Manta WebAPI

This repository is part of the Joyent Manta project.  For contribution
guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta) project page.

manta-muskie holds the source code for the Manta WebAPI, otherwise known as
"the front door".  It is analogous to CloudAPI for SDC.  See the restdown
docs for API information, but effectively this is where you go to call
PUT/GET/DEL on your stuff.

API, design and developer documentation are in the `docs` directory as
[restdown](https://github.com/trentm/restdown) files.
